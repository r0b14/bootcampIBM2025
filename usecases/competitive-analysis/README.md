## 🤔 The Problem

ABC Robots' sales department faced challenges in preparing sales proposals for their new line of high performance home cleaning robots. Every time they release a new model, the competitive analysis team spends a great amount of time and resources to deliver their insights. Issues include: 

- Manual research delays decisions and reduces productivity.

- Weak positioning hampers sales differentiation.

- Slow response to market changes without real-time intelligence.
