## Use Case Description

ABC Robots plans to implement an AI-powered Competitive Intelligence System to automate market research and competitor analysis. This system will help sales teams quickly identify and position their products against competitors, overcoming the inefficiencies of manual research and outdated insights. The goal is to create an AI-enabled system that supports competitive analysis and market research by:

* Extracting products from the company’s product catalog
* Identifying and extracting key features of each product
* Searching for competitor products based on key attributes
* Generating a structured competitive comparison table with price, features, and differentiators

By automating these tasks, the company aims to accelerate sales processes, improve data accuracy, and enable sales teams to make informed decisions faster.

## Lab Steps Overview
1. Connect to watsonx Orchestrate
2. Create the Identifier Agent - uses MCP Tool extract_from_image
3. Create the Comparison Analysis Agent - uses MCP Tool search_and_review_high_rated_products
4. Create the ABC Robots Agent - RAG agent
5. Create the Master Agent - orchestrator agent

Let's get started. 
## Lab Instructions
### Connect to your assigned Watsonx Orchestrate instance

1. Log in to IBM Cloud (cloud.ibm.com). Navigate to the top-left hamburger menu, then to **Resource List**. Open the **AI/Machine Learning** section. You should see a **watsonx Orchestrate** service. Click to open it.

   ![Watsonx Orchestrate service](./assets/i1.png)

2. Click the **Launch watsonx Orchestrate** button:

   ![Launch Watsonx Orchestrate](./assets/i2.png)
  
### Create Identifier Agent

The Identifier Agent recognizes a product from an image. It relies on a service predeployed in an MCP server that invokes a watsonx.ai hosted multi-modal model for image recognition. Let's integrate this service into a watsonx Orchestrate agent.

> [!TIP]
> An MCP server is a live deployment of an implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which gives standardized access to external tools, data, and services securely and consistently.

1. Go to the watsonx Orchestrate home page, click on the hamburger menu (☰), select **Build**, and then **Agent Builder**.
![Agent Builder](assets/BAP_1.png)

2. Click on the **Create agent** button.
![Create Agent](assets/BAP_2.png)

3. Select **Create from scratch**, add the following information:
   
   **Name**:
   ```
   Identifier Agent
   ```
   **Description**:
        
   ```
   This agent will extract the brand name and product name from the image.
   ```

   Click on **Create** button

   ![Create from scratch](assets/id_create.png)

4. Go to the **Toolset** section and click on **Add tool**:
   ![Add tool](assets/id_tool.png)

5. Select **Add from file or MCP server**:
   ![Add MCP Server](assets/id_add_mcp.png)

6. Select **Import from MCP server**:
   ![Import from MCP Server](assets/id_import_mcp.png)

7. On the **Import or remove tools from MCP server** window, click **Add MCP server**:
   ![Add MCP Server](assets/id_add_mcp_button.png)

8. On the **Add MCP server** window add the following parameters and then click **Connect**:

   - Server Name:
     ```
     mcp-competitive-tools
     ```
   - Get the MCP Server URL from your instructor and fill it in the Install command as follows:
     ```
     uvx mcp-proxy [MCP-SERVER-URL]/sse
     ```
     > e.g., `uvx mcp-proxy https://remote-mcp-tools.20sp7brq6u6i.us-south.codeengine.appdomain.cloud/sse`

   ![Server Details](assets/id_server_details.png)

9. You should see a `Connection successful` message underneath. Click **Done**:
   ![Connection Successful](assets/id_connect.png)

10. On the **Import or remove tools from MCP server** window, toggle on the `extract_from_image` tool to **On** then close the window.
   ![Toogle tool](assets/id_image_toggle.png)

11. Now let's define what the agent is supposed to do in the **Behavior** section. Let's be specific in terms of the format we want to get from the image recognition agent. Try the following **Instructions**:

    ```
    I will share an image URL. Please use the extract_from_image tool to parse the content. From the extracted text or context, identify the exact product name and brand name from the reference image. This information will be used by the Competitive Analysis Agent.

    Return the result in this format:

    Brand Name :
   
    Product Name:
    ```
    ![Behavior](assets/id_behavior.png)

12. Let's test the agent on the spot by loading the following image. We will pass the corresponding URL for the agent to recognize the product:
   <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/613mvDKX1hL._AC_SL1500_.jpg" width="400">
  
13. Type the following query in the chat on the right side in the **Preview** window:

    ```
    Tell me what product is in this image https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/613mvDKX1hL._AC_SL1500_.jpg
    ```
   
   ![Behavior](assets/id_test.png)

14. You can now deploy the agent. Click the **Deploy** button and then the **Deploy** again on the **Pre-deployment summary** window:

    ![Deploy](assets/id_deploy.png)
    ![Deploy](assets/id_deploy_2.png)

    You will now see that your agent is **Live** and you can chat with it directly.  We will demonstrate this later in the lab.

    ![Deploy](assets/id_live.png)

## Create Comp Analysis Agent

Now, let's create the Comp Analysis Agent. This one allows to get information from products in the market using Google Search and Google Shopping APIs. 

We use the SerpAPI to invoke these services and then exposed them as tools in the MCP server for easier invocation from the Agent in watsonx Orchestrate.

1. Click on the **Manage Agents** link in the breadcrumb menu at top left.
   ![Manage Agent](assets/id_manage_agent.png)

    ```
    Specs query → Structured summary of that product from KB (exact text, no paraphrasing).
    Comparison query → Generate a side-by-side comparison from KB. Each distinct function, feature, or specification must be presented as a separate row in the table (e.g., individual rows for "Cleaning Modes", "Battery Life", "Navigation System", "Dustbin Capacity", etc.). Do not consolidate multiple features into grouped rows like "Core Functions" or "Main Features".
    Competitive analysis vs KB → Compare a given product (if in KB) vs all KB products.
    No relevant data → Output strictly:
    
    The information required cannot be found in the current knowledge base. Please upload the relevant data in a supported format (e.g., CSV, TSV, or text document).

    ```
    ![Upload file](assets/abc_behavior.png)

11. Now you can test your agent. Ask questions about ABC robots products, or specific information for any product.

7. Select the **ABC Robots Agent**, the **Comp Analysis Agent** and the **Identifier Agent**, then click the **Add to Agent** button.

   ![Add Agents](./assets/master_add_agents.png)

8. In the **Behavior** section, add the following to the **Instructions** text field:

    ```
    The Master Agent does not answer queries directly. Its only responsibility is to route queries to the appropriate specialised agents, manage state between interactions, and ensure downstream queries are context-aware.
    Routing Rules
    Image-based Product Identification:
    If a user query contains an image or explicitly asks “Tell me what product is in the image,” route the query to the Identifier Agent.
    After the response is received from the Identifier Agent, display the brand name and model name and ask the user - “Would you like me to pull information for this product?”.
    If the user answers "Yes," provide the output from the Identifier Agent to the comp-analysis-ag and, from the response received, analyze and understand the response to provide a detailed and very long answer, divided into specifications, features, and reviews only. Ensure there is no none response in the headers.
    Customer Perception Summary:
    If a user queries "Give me the summary of how this product is perceived by customers, broken down into good and bad," then provide a detailed breakdown of reviews divided into good and bad from the response already received from comp-analysis-ag.
    Competitive Analysis against Knowledge Base:
    If a user queries “Do a competitive analysis of this product against the knowledge base,” then a detailed comparison needs to be done between the response already received from comp-analysis-ag and the knowledge base from ABC Robots (all the products). Extract all information from the knowledge base and compare all features, price, and ratings against comp-analysis-ag. Understand and analyze, then provide that response in a detailed and long tabular manner. Decide on columns nicely for its table, making sure all comparisons are under one table.
    Product-specific Queries (ABC Robots):
    If a user queries “Give me a comparison between Aerowash X1 and Nimbus S7,” or “Give me the specifications of Aerowash X1,” "Give me the products of ABC robots" (in products of ABC, just provide a list of products and the table should be nicely proportionate), or similar queries like this with other product names too, then redirect it to ABC Robots.
    Display features, pricing, or any other relevant detailed answers along with their respective sub-headings in a detailed and a long tabular manner vertically.
    The answer should start with "Based on the knowledge base, here is the comparison between HydraClean V9 and Nimbus S7" (or relevant products), in a tabular format vertically only for other products too. Analyze the products and then provide columns and their rows of comparison nicely.
    At the end, give your detailed and a long comparison analysis too after the tabular comparison.
    Competitive Analysis with Top Competitors:
    If a user queries “Give me a competitive analysis of HydraClean v9 and the top competitors in the market” (there can be any product instead of HydraClean v9), route the query to comp-analysis-ag and pass this query “HydraClean v9 and top competitors in the market” only.
    Once a response is received, understand and analyze it, and provide a new tabular response (decide on columns and rows smartly). In the end, give your detailed analysis.
   ```

9. Click the **Deploy** button at the top right to deploy the agent to the live environment:

   ![Steps](assets/master_deploy.png)
   
10. Click the **Deploy** button again on the **Pre-deployment summary** window:

    ![Deploy](assets/master_deploy_agent.png)

    You will now see that your agent is **Live** and you can chat with it directly.

   You will then be asked "Would you like me to pull information for this model?". Respond with `yes`:
   
   ![Comparison Agent Response](assets/chat_q5.png)
   
5. To do some competitive analysis, try these prompts:
   ```
   Give me the specifications of the product in the image
   ```
   <!--  ![ABC Agent Response](assets/chat_q6.png) -->

   ```
   Give me a summary of how this product is perceived by customers
   ```
   ![ABC Agent Response](assets/chat_q7.png)

   ```
   Give me a competitive analysis of the product in the image against each of the products in the catalog for ABC robots. Break it down by individual features in a table. Include Laundry and Dishwashing as well. Put it all together into a single table.
   ```

   <img width="685" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-04 at 11 26 16 AM" src="https://github.ibm.com/skol/agentic-ai-client-bootcamp/assets/12043/cdde7a14-cd88-4f2a-bdcd-7c8869d9ee53">
